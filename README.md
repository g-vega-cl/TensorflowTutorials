# TensorflowTutorials
The tutorials in tensorflow.org tensorflow 2.0
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/

The files have comments and a few modifications by me to make the code more understandable.

Each tutorial category is in its respective folder. And the notebooks have the link to the Tensorflow site.
